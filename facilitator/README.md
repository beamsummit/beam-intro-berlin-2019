This section contains utilities for facilitators of the workshop. These 
utilities include setup, and configuration.

## Setting up the Flink Clusters

The Flink UI will be in port TODO

## Tips

* **Request Quota**. Remember to do it early: CPUs, IP addresses, Networks. Requests are not immediately granted.
* **Use a permissive Firewall Rule**. The project should have very few things in it, so it's safe to simply allow all ingress traffic for the workshop.
