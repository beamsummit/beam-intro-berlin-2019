Welcome to the Intro to Beam Workshop for the Summit in Berlin : )
This workshop will explore the basic concepts of the Beam model and the Beam API in Python and Java. Unfortunately, no Go examples, but if you’re interested in the Go SDK, please check out [the Go Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-go/).

This workshop will be led largely by @pabloem.  @??(Reza), @??(Kannapan) leading the pattern sessions, and a bunch of others from the community helping out with instruction during hands-on sessions.  With @brucearctor facilitating.

| 12:00 - 12:30 |Loading and start working on the Beam Katas |
| 12:30 - 13:30 | Lunch (and work on the Katas with instructors) |
| 13:30 - 14:00 | Patterns from building some real world pipelines: prelude |
| 14:00 - 15:00 | Submitting Beam Jobs; Getting Setup for Prod, more Katas |

## **Requirements and setup** ##

This workshop relies on a few things that we recommend you install beforehand.

**Operating System Requirements**

The educational materials have been tested by us in Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Please setup the project using Java 8 only.

  * **For Java:** IntelliJ
    * With the EduTools plugin: 
      https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=idea
  * **For Python:** PyCharm or IntelliJ with the Python plugin
    * With the EduTools Plugin: 
      https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=pycharm-edu
      
* If you’re not using the latest IntelliJ or PyCharm, please ensure that the EduTools plugin is version 2.5+

### **Opening the Beam Katas** ###
1. Upon opening the IDE, you can open the course by clicking "Learn and Teach" > "Browse Courses".
2. Search and select the corresponding course 
* “Beam Kata - Java” for IntelliJ Edu
* “Beam Kata - Python” for PyCharm Edu
3. Select your JDK or Python interpreter by expanding the “Advanced Settings”.
* Please use JDK 8 and Python 2.7 only.
* Then click "Join"
4. You're good to go.
